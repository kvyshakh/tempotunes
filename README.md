# Tempo Tunes
An Android app using the Spotify SDK and Myo SDK. We wanted to be able to have our music adapt to the way we worked out. As a runner picks up the pace during a cardio workout, the music would get more intense. As the runner cools  down at the end of the workout, the music would adapt and decrease in intensity. The app would randomly select songs from different Spotify playlists that are classified as low-intensity, medium-intensity, and high-intensity. Future improvements could involve allowing user to create their own playlists for each category of music intensity. Improvements could also allow app to learn from itself and adapt its motion tracking to change its music based on an individual's style of running.
